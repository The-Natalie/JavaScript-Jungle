    		<p>We'll be exploring the lesser-known JavaScript terms (at least for us newbies) - one per email. These are the methods and properties that aren't usually taught in beginner or even intermediate courses. Some of them may be familiar to you, but we'll go over them just in case. This is a quick but informative newsletter, and will take 5 minues or less to read.</p>
